                    <p>My capstone project included myself working along side 4 other developers to develope an application.
                        The application of our choice origionated from an origional idea I had in high school but was uneducated
                        to complete it on my own. The final name of the application is "Grubber". Grubber is a service provider
                        to help advertise services in an Uber like way where people and companies can post listings of their work
                        and whomever is in need of such a service can schedule it.
